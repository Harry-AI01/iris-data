# Iris Dataset Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook project explores the classic Iris dataset through basic data analysis techniques. The Iris dataset contains 150 records of iris flowers, including measurements of sepals and petals (length and width), along with the species of iris (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). Our analysis includes data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
